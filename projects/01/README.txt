Linux Build Instructions

To build these files, type the following:
cd <Project_Directory>/
javac *.java

To run the program, type the following:
java memman <bytes> <records> <file>

-------------------------------------------

NOTE: This program assumes that the commands
have the proper number of arguments.

NOTE: This program checks city names to make
sure that they only contain letters and
underscores. It prints an error otherwise;
however, the program can work fine with all
other characters (the check for wrong characters
just needs to be removed).
